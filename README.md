# Gold-Output-Predictor
Here I prepared a prototype of a machine learning model for Project 9 of Yandex's Practicum. The data was provided by Zyfra, which develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model predicts the amount of gold recovered from gold ore by using data on extraction and purification. The model can help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

Note: Data files were too large to upload to Github.
